 # Zen Productivity App

Welcome to the Zen Productivity App! This app is designed to boost your productivity and mindfulness by combining ancient techniques with modern technology. It's not just a meditation timer; it's also a tool to help you track and understand your thoughts.

## What You Can Do with This App (in initial production phases so it is only front end right now)

### Meditation Timer
Set a timer for your meditation sessions to help you stay focused. The timer has a simple play/pause feature and a clean design to keep you engaged.

### Thought Tracker
Ever get interrupted by random thoughts while meditating? With this app, you can quickly jot down those thoughts. This helps you stay focused during meditation and lets you review your thoughts later.

### Thought Pattern Analysis
The app uses a smart algorithm to look for patterns in your thoughts. Over time, it creates a visual tree that shows how your thoughts are connected. This tree grows the more you use the app, giving you a clear picture of your thought patterns.

### Interactive Experience
